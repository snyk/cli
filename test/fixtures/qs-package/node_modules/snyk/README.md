# Documentation

Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in Node.js npm packages, both ad hoc and as part of your CI (Build) system.

* Get started with our __<a href="https://snyk.io/docs/quick-start/" title="Quick start guide">step-by-step guide.</a>__
* <a href="https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/" title="Using Snyk">__Check our full documentation on snyk.io__</a> for details.

Note: Snyk is currently in beta. [Email us your feedback](mailto:support@snyk.io).

## CLI

```console
snyk [options] [command] [package]
```

The package argument is optional. If no package is given, Snyk will run the command against the current working directory allowing you test you non-public applications.

Run `snyk --help` to get a quick overview of all commands.

## Integrating Snyk into your dev workflow

To continuously avoid known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, integrate Snyk into your continuous integration (CI, a.k.a. build) system. Here are the steps required to so:

1. Install the Snyk utility using `npm install -g snyk`.
2. Run `snyk wizard` in the directory of your project following the prompts which will also generate a `.snyk` policy file.
3. Ensure the `.snyk` file you generated was added to your source control (`git add .snyk`).
4. If you selected to, Snyk will include `snyk test` as part of your `npm test` command, so if there are new vulnerabilities in the future, your CI will fail protecting you from introducing vulnerabilities to production.

## Badge

Once youâ€™re vulnerability free, you can put a badge on your README showing your package has no known security holes. This will show your users you care about security, and tell them that they should care too.

If there are no vulnerabilities, this is indicated by a green badge.

If vulnerabilities have been found, the red badge will show the number of vulnerabilities.
