[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1msnyk test [22m[[4mOPTIONS[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Test  command checks locally installed projects for vulnerabilities. It
       tries to autodetect supported manifest files with dependencies and test
       those.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       To  see  command-specific  flags and usage, see [1mhelp [22mcommand, e.g. [1msnyk[0m
       [1mcontainer --help[22m. For advanced usage, we  offer  language  and  context
       specific flags, listed further down this document.

       [1m--all-projects[0m
              (only  in [1mtest [22mand [1mmonitor [22mcommands) Auto-detect all projects in
              working directory

       [1m--detection-depth[22m=[4mDEPTH[0m
              (only in [1mtest [22mand [1mmonitor [22mcommands) Use with  --all-projects  or
              --yarn-workspaces   to  indicate  how  many  sub-directories  to
              search. [1mDEPTH [22mmust be a number.

              Default: 4 (the current working directory and 3 sub-directories)

       [1m--exclude[22m=[4mDIRECTORY[24m[,[4mDIRECTORY[24m]...>
              (only  in  [1mtest  [22mand  [1mmonitor  [22mcommands)  Can   be   used   with
              --all-projects and --yarn-workspaces to indicate sub-directories
              and files to exclude. Must be comma separated.

              If using with [1m--detection-depth [22mexclude ignores  directories  at
              any level deep.

       [1m--prune-repeated-subdependencies[22m, [1m-p[0m
              (only  in [1mtest [22mand [1mmonitor [22mcommands) Prune dependency trees, re-
              moving duplicate sub-dependencies. Will still find all  vulnera-
              bilities, but potentially not all of the vulnerable paths.

       [1m--print-deps[0m
              (only  in  [1mtest  [22mand [1mmonitor [22mcommands) Print the dependency tree
              before sending it for analysis.

       [1m--remote-repo-url[22m=[4mURL[0m
              Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would
              like to monitor.

       [1m--dev  [22mInclude  development-only dependencies. Applicable only for some
              package managers. E.g. [4mdevDependencies[24m in  npm  or  [4m:development[0m
              dependencies in Gemfile.

              Default: scan only production dependencies

       [1m--org[22m=[4mORG_NAME[0m
              Specify the [4mORG_NAME[24m to run Snyk commands tied to a specific or-
              ganization. This will influence where will new projects be  cre-
              ated  after  running [1mmonitor [22mcommand, some features availability
              and private tests limits. If you  have  multiple  organizations,
              you can set a default from the CLI using:

              [1m$ snyk config set org[22m=[4mORG_NAME[0m

              Setting  a default will ensure all newly monitored projects will
              be created under your default organization. If you need to over-
              ride the default, you can use the [1m--org[22m=[4mORG_NAME[24m argument.

              Default: uses [4mORG_NAME[24m that sets as default in your Account set-
              tings [4mhttps://app.snyk.io/account[0m

       [1m--file[22m=[4mFILE[0m
              Sets a package file.

              When testing locally or monitoring a project,  you  can  specify
              the  file that Snyk should inspect for package information. When
              ommitted Snyk will try to detect the appropriate file  for  your
              project.

       [1m--ignore-policy[0m
              Ignores  all set policies. The current policy in [1m.snyk [22mfile, Org
              level ignores and the project policy on snyk.io.

       [1m--trust-policies[0m
              Applies and uses ignore rules from your dependencies' Snyk poli-
              cies, otherwise ignore policies are only shown as a suggestion.

              Display  the  dependency  paths from the top level dependencies,
              down to the vulnerable packages. Doesn't affect output when  us-

              Default:  [4msome[24m (a few example paths shown) [4mfalse[24m is an alias for
              [4mnone[24m.

       [1m--project-name[22m=[4mPROJECT_NAME[0m

       [1m--target-reference[22m=[4mTARGET_REFERENCE[0m
              A reference to separate this project from  other  scans  of  the
              same  project.  For  example, a branch name or version. Projects
              using the same reference can be used for grouping. More informa-

              to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use  the
              [1m--json  [22moption. This is especially useful if you want to display
              the human-readable test output via stdout and at the  same  time
              save the JSON format output to a file.

       [1m--sarif[0m

              to the [4mOUTPUT_FILE_PATH[24m file, regardless of whether or  not  you
              use the [1m--sarif [22moption. This is especially useful if you want to
              display the human-readable test output via  stdout  and  at  the

              [4mall[24m  fails  when there is at least one vulnerability that can be
              either upgraded or patched. [4mupgradable[24m fails when  there  is  at
              least  one  vulnerability  that can be upgraded. [4mpatchable[24m fails
              when there is at least one vulnerability that can be patched.

              If vulnerabilities do not have a fix and this  option  is  being
              used, tests will pass.
