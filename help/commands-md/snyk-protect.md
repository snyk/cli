### `SNYK_CFG_KEY`

Allows you to override any key that's also available as `snyk config` option.

E.g. `SNYK_CFG_ORG=myorg` will override default org option in `config` with "myorg".

### `SNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME`

Specify a username to use when connecting to a container registry. Note that using the `--username` flag will override this value. This will be ignored in favour of local Docker binary credentials when Docker is present.

### `SNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

Specify a password to use when connecting to a container registry. Note that using the `--password` flag will override this value. This will be ignored in favour of local Docker binary credentials when Docker is present.

## Connecting to Snyk API

By default Snyk CLI will connect to `https://snyk.io/api/v1`.

### `SNYK_API`

Sets API host to use for Snyk requests. Useful for on-premise instances and configuring proxies. If set with `http` protocol CLI will upgrade the requests to `https`. Unless `SNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE` is set to `0`.

### `SNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE=0`

If set to the value of `0`, API requests aimed at `http` URLs will not be upgraded to `https`. If not set, the default behavior will be to upgrade these requests from `http` to `https`. Useful e.g., for reverse proxies.

### `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`

Allows you to specify a proxy to use for `https` and `http` calls. The `https` in the `HTTPS_PROXY` means that _requests using `https` protocol_ will use this proxy. The proxy itself doesn't need to use `https`.
