\fB$ snyk config set org\fR=\fIORG_NAME\fR
.IP
Setting a default will ensure all newly tested projects will be tested under your default organization\. If you need to override the default, you can use the \fB\-\-org\fR=\fIORG_NAME\fR argument\.

\fBSNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE\fR=0
If set to the value of \fB0\fR, API requests aimed at \fBhttp\fR URLs will not be upgraded to \fBhttps\fR\. If not set, the default behavior will be to upgrade these requests from \fBhttp\fR to \fBhttps\fR\. Useful e\.g\., for reverse proxies\.
.TP
\fBHTTPS_PROXY\fR and \fBHTTP_PROXY\fR
Allows you to specify a proxy to use for \fBhttps\fR and \fBhttp\fR calls\. The \fBhttps\fR in the \fBHTTPS_PROXY\fR means that \fIrequests using \fBhttps\fR protocol\fR will use this proxy\. The proxy itself doesn\'t need to use \fBhttps\fR\.
